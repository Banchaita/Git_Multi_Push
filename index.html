                <b>Soccer</b> originated over 3000 years ago when it was first played by the <b>Aztecs</b>. They called it Tchatali and played with a rock 
                for a ball. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE, the first ball game, called Cuju, took place in China. They played with a leather 
                ball filled with feathers. In ancient <b>Greece</b> and Rome, ball games were also played, however, not at the Panhellenic Games or in 
                amphitheaters.
